Second Music System is a middleware library focused on dynamic music. It gives a lot of flexibility to musicians, while being as easy as possible to integrate into an existing game engine, and also having no opinions on the details of audio input or output.

It is STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, barely documented, not necessarily production ready.
